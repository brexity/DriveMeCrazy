# 📝 Overview

DriveMeCrazy is a dating website for vehicles.
"Tinder for cars – because vehicles deserve love too."
A ridiculously useless dating platform for vehicles, built for Wreckathon 2025.

# 🎯 Inspiration

Let’s face it — in a world of self-driving cars and emotionally neglected sedans, it's about time vehicles had a space to connect. Whether it’s a lonely Prius looking for a high-mileage companion or a monster truck tired of being judged for its size, Drive Me Crazy gives vehicles the chance to swipe, match, and maybe even rev together.

Built for Wreckathon, where creativity, comedy, and uselessness rule supreme.

# 🛠️ What It Does

🔥 Swipe right to rev your engine in excitement

🚫 Swipe left to honk in rejection

💬 Chat system for matched vehicles (because love starts with small talk about horsepower)

💘 Randomized vehicle profiles with absurd bios, fake stats, and matching vibes

🧠 Artificial intelligence? Nah. Artificial stupidity.
